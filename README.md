## Conceptual phase
The interactive drawing assignment requires a collection of shapes and colors that the user can interact with using if statements, loops and arrays.  
The first thing that comes to mind when interacting with a 2D space is a tabletop or desk, this gives me the idea to make an interactive ritual circle.  

If I were to have the background look like a wooden countertop, a circle and triangle in the center and a variety of items along the borders, I could create  
a recognizable space.  
To have the player interact within this space, I could assign keyboard inputs to certain runes that appear in the circle, having a book or some kind of slate the player can view to know which keys to press.

## Loops and Arrays
The gaps in the background that make the desk look like a desk can be created using a simple for loop, however the assignment requires that the code contain two loops and two arrays.  
The challenge here is finding out where exactly I can place use loops and arrays, as the assignment should be achieveable without.

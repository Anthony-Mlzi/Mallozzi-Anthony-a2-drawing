Assignment two repository for Game Development Foundations

## Conceptual phase
The interactive drawing assignment requires a collection of shapes and colors that the user can interact with using if statements, loops and arrays.  
The first thing that comes to mind when interacting with a 2D space is a tabletop or desk, this gives me the idea to make an interactive ritual circle.  

If I were to have the background look like a wooden countertop, a circle and triangle in the center and a variety of items along the borders, I could create  
a recognizable space.  
To have the player interact within this space, I could assign keyboard inputs to certain runes that appear in the circle, having a book or some kind of slate the player can view to know which keys to press.

## Loops and Arrays
The gaps in the background that make the desk look like a desk can be created using a simple for loop, however the assignment requires that the code contain two loops and two arrays.  
The challenge here is finding out where exactly I can place use loops and arrays, as the assignment should be achieveable without.

## drawings
Any environment designer will tell you that to fill a space, you'll need lots of assets, props fill the space, give rooms personality and help the environment feel more real. However, this is not a 3d space, and asset placement is more tricky, so I will fill the scene with lighting to give a more believeable space. By having a shade effect at the top of the screen and a glow in the center of the symbol, it gives the environment a sort of depth.

## animations
To have the scene give more of a "alive" feeling, I've added a small growing circle underneath each rune as it appears using DeltaTime, almost giving the appearance of a UI selection marker.

## User Instructions
Use the mouse to move around the window and get your bearings, the A, B and C keys correspond to the drawing animations.
